 E-Commerce Deals Display App
 Overview :
 
This project is a Django-based web application that displays e-commerce deals stored in local files (CSV). The data is scraped beforehand (not live) from selected e-commerce websites and then presented on the webpage. Each deal includes a redirect link to the original product page.
 
Features :

 --> Reads deals from pre-scraped data files (CSV or JSON).
 
 --> Displays deals in a clean and responsive UI.
 
 -->  Redirects users to the original product page.
 
 -->  Fast loading since data is read from local storage.
 
Tech Stack :

--> Backend: Django (Python).

--> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

--> Data Source: Local CSV/JSON files (scraped beforehand)

Notes :

--> This app does not scrape data in real-time. The scraping was done beforehand, and the results are stored in local files for display purposes.

--> You can replace the sample CSV with your own data.
